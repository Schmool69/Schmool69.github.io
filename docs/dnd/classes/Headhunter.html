</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Ranged Signature Weapon Benefits:</strong></p>

</ul>

<h2>Level 2  Tactical Maneuver</h2>
<p>As a bonus action, choose one of the following options:</p>
<p><strong>Pursue:</strong> Move up to 10 feet directly toward your Target. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw:</strong> If your Target is within 10 feet of you, you may move up to 10 feet directly away from them without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Level 7  Pressure Point Analysis</h2>

<h2>Level 9  Efficient Recovery</h2>
<p>Once per long rest, when you finish a short rest, you may restore yourself to full hit points (instead of using hit dice).</p>

<h2>Level 11  Chain Designation</h2>
<p>You can maintain up to two Targets at the same time. All passive Target-based class features apply to both Targets.

<h2>Level 13  Signature Weapon Upgrade II</h2>
<p><strong>Melee Options:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Concentrate:</strong> If you haven't moved on your turn, your first attack against your Target deals extra Killshot damage equal to your proficiency bonus</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 14  Adaptive Focus</h2>
<p>You gain complete control over your Target system.</p>
<p><strong>Choose Your Target:</strong> As a bonus action, you may select any hostile creature you can see within 120 feet to become your Target. This bypasses the usual random assignment.</p>

<h2>Level 15  Evanesce</h2>
<p>Your disappearance techniques evolve into a reliable cloaking method. You may activate Evanesce when any of the following occur: You reduce a creature to 0 hit points or you take the Hide action.</p>
<p>When you activate Evanesce, you gain:</p>
<ul>
<li>You become hidden if there is any concealment or cover</li>
<li>If no cover is present, you instead gain heavily obscured status against your Target until the start of your next turn, treating yourself as effectively invisible to them</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature may be used a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier, refreshing on a long rest.</p>

<h2>Level 17  Apex Predator</h2>
<p>Your Killshot becomes devastatingly efficient. When you deal Killshot damage to your Target:</p>

<li>If your Target has no allies within 30 feet, double the Killshot damage dice.</li>
</ul>
