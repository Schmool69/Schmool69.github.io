<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Choose 2 from: Athletics, Acrobatics, Animal Handling, History, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Perception, Survival</p>

<h2>Level 1  Combat Doctrine</h2>
<p>You adopt a combat doctrine that shapes how you fight. You can change your active doctrine as a bonus action on your turn. Choose one doctrine at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assault Doctrine:</strong> +2 bonus to damage rolls on your turn</li>
<li><strong>Defense Doctrine:</strong> +1 AC and advantage on opportunity attack saving throws</li>
<li><strong>Mobility Doctrine:</strong> Your speed increases by 10 feet and standing up costs only 5 feet of movement</li>
</ul>
<p>At level 11, you may maintain two doctrines simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Level 1  Suppressive Fire</h2>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you may force it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failure, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</p>

<h2>Level 2  Military Grit</h2>
<p>You can push beyond normal limits. On your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.</p>

<h2>Level 3  Marine Corps</h2>
<p>Choose a Marine corps that reflects your specialized training:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/docs/dnd/sublasses/Marine/shocktrooper.html">Shock Trooper</a> - Brutal melee warrior</li>
<li><a href="/docs/dnd/sublasses/Marine/infantrygunner.html">Infantry Gunner</a> - strategic ranged combat</li>
<li><a href="/docs/dnd/sublasses/Marine/siegemarine.html">Siege Marine</a> - one man tank</li>
</ul>
<p>Your archetype grants features at levels 3, 7, 10, 14, and 18.</p>

<h2>Level 5  Extra Attack</h2>
<p>Make two attacks from one attack action.</p>

<h2>Level 6  Field Conditioning</h2>
<p>You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws if you don't already have it. If you do, you instead gain advantage on Constitution saving throws against exhaustion, poison, and environmental hazards.</p>

<h2>Level 9  Indomitable Advance</h2>
<p>Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage, and you can move through hostile creature spaces as if they were difficult terrain.</p>

<h2>Level 11  Improved Suppression</h2>
<p>When a creature fails its save against your Suppressive Fire, its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.</p>

<h2>Level 13  Veteran Reflexes</h2>
<p>You gain advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be surprised while conscious.</p>

<h2>Level 15  Combat Endurance</h2>
<p>When you drop to 0 hit points but aren't killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once used, you must finish a long rest before using this feature again.</p>

<h2>Level 17  Relentless Assault</h2>
<p>If you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points on your turn, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of the same action.</p>

<h2>Level 20  War Machine</h2>
<p>At the start of combat, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Marine level + Constitution modifier, and your first attack each turn automatically benefits from Suppressive Fire without expending a use.</p>
