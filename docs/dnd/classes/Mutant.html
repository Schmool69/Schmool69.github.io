<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Choose 2 from: Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception, Survival, Intimidation, Stealth</p>

<h2>Level 1  Instinctive Aptitude</h2>
<p>Your mutated nervous system processes threats differently. Choose one of the skills you are proficient in. When you make a check with that skill, you may use your Constitution modifier instead of the normal ability score.</p>

<h2>Level 1  Adaptive Surge</h2>
<p>You can push your body beyond safe limits. You have a number of Surges equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain all Surges on a short or long rest. Activating a Surge is a bonus action.</p>
<p>When you activate a Surge, choose one effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain advantage on a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check or save</li>
<li>Add your Constitution modifier to an attack roll</li>
<li>Increase your speed by 10 ft until the end of your turn</li>
<li>Gain temporary HP equal to your Mutant level</li>
</ul>
<p>Surges are physically disturbing processes and people will react as such.</p>

<h2>Level 2  Reactive Biology</h2>
<p>When you take a damage type for the first time in an encounter, or fail a saving throw, you may use your reaction to gain one of the following until the start of your next turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance to that damage type</li>
<li>Advantage on the next saving throw of that type</li>
<li>+2 AC against the triggering attack type</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier per long rest.</p>

<h2>Level 3  Mutation Strain</h2>
<p>Choose a subclass:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/dnd/sublasses/Mutant/brute.html">Brute Strain</a> - raw power, mass, and durability</li>
<li><a href="/dnd/sublasses/Mutant/aberrant.html">Aberrant Strain</a> - unsettling forms, control effects</li>
<li><a href="/dnd/sublasses/Mutant/swarm.html">Swarm Strain</a> - Aura effects through hivemind abilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Each mutation strain is tied to a visible change listed in each initial feature.</p>

<h2>Level 5  Extra Attack</h2>
<p>You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action.</p>

<h2>Level 6  Deep Mutation</h2>
<p>Choose a permanent mutation with benefits and drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oversized Frame:</strong> +2 AC, disadvantage on stealth checks</li>
<li><strong>Long Limbs:</strong> +5 attack range +10 movement speed, creatures have advantage on opportunity attacks against you</li>
<li><strong>Necrotic System:</strong> No longer need to eat/sleep, lose 1 hit dice</li>
<li><strong>Unsettling Presence:</strong> Proficiency/expertise in intimidation and can use con instead of cha, you have disadvantage on Persuasion checks made to appear friendly or trustworthy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 7  Menacing Biology</h2>
<p>When you enter combat, choose one creature you can see within 30 ft. That creature has disadvantage on its first attack roll made against any target other than you. If the creature attacks you, you gain temporary HP equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>

<h2>Level 9  Adaptive Surge Improvement</h2>
<p>When you activate Adaptive Surge, you now gain two effects instead of one from the Surge list. Additionally, add the following Surge options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force a creature you hit this turn to make a Strength save (DC = 8 + PB + CON) or be pushed 10 ft</li>
<li>Gain advantage on the next constitution check (including instinctive aptitude)</li>
<li>Reducing a creature to 0 hitpoints this turn refunds the surge</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 10  Unstable Resilience</h2>
<p>Once per turn, when you take damage, reduce the damage by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier. If this reduces the damage to 0, you may move up to 10 ft without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<h2>Level 11  Relentless Assault</h2>
<p>Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action. When you hit with an opportunity attack, the target's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn.</p>

<h2>Level 13  Adaptive Overload</h2>
<p>When you activate Adaptive Surge, you may gain one additional Surge effect (for a total of three). If you do, you take necrotic damage equal to your Mutant level at the end of your turn (ignores resistance).</p>

<h2>Level 14  Undeniable Force</h2>
<p>Creatures within 5 ft of you have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you. When a creature within 5 ft of you misses an attack, you may use your reaction to make a melee attack against it.</p>

<h2>Level 15  Perfected Biology</h2>
<p>Your Reactive Biology feature now lasts until the end of the encounter. You can maintain adaptations against two different damage types or effects simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Level 17  Dominant Presence</h2>
<p>Enemies that start their turn within 10 ft of you have their speed reduced by 10 ft. If they attempt to move out of this area, you may make an opportunity attack as a reaction, even if they normally would not provoke one.</p>

<h2>Level 18  Adaptive Mastery</h2>
<p>You regain 1 Adaptive Surge at the start of each of your turns if you have none remaining. You may activate Adaptive Surge once per turn without using a bonus action.</p>

<h2>Level 20  Living Weapon</h2>
<p>Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. At the start of each combat, you automatically gain the benefits of Adaptive Surge without expending a use.</p>
<p>When you reduce a creature to 0 HP, you may immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move up to half your speed</li>
<li>And make one melee attack</li>
</ul>
