<h2>New Condition: Unnerved</h2>
<p>A creature that is unnerved suffers the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws</li>
<li>If the creature is frightened, it also:
  <ul>
  <li>Cannot take reactions</li>
  <li>Treats all creatures as lightly obscured beyond 10 ft (tunnel vision, stress)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Unnerved condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lasts for the duration specified by the effect that caused it</li>
<li>Does not stack with itself</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 3  Visceral Wrongness</h2>
<p>Your presence triggers an involuntary fear response in living creatures.</p>
<p>When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may force it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Constitution modifier).</p>
<p>On a failure, the creature becomes unnerved until the end of your next turn. If the creature was already unnerved, it instead becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>You may only apply this feature once per turn.</p>
<p><em>Visible Change: Eyes reflecting light incorrectly, breath that doesn't match exertion, skin pulling tight in unnatural patterns.</em></p>

<h2>Level 6  Panic Cascade</h2>
<p>When a creature that is unnerved or frightened misses you with an attack, you may use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw.</p>
<p>On a failure:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is unnerved, it becomes frightened of you until the end of its next turn</li>
<li>If it is frightened, it is also restrained until the start of its next turn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 10  Sustained Dread</h2>
<p>When a creature becomes frightened of you due to one of your Aberrant Strain features, the condition lasts for one round as normal.</p>
<p>However, if the frightened condition would end when the creature is within 15 ft of you, the frightened condition instead continues.</p>
<p>The frightened condition ends only when the creature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ends its turn more than 15 ft away from you, or you are incapacitated</li>
<li>This does not maintain the restrained effect from panic cascade</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 14  Unbearable Reality</h2>
<p>At the start of a creature's turn within 10 ft of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is unnerved, it must succeed on a Wisdom save or become frightened</li>
<li>If it is frightened, it takes psychic damage equal to your Constitution modifier and has disadvantage on its next saving throw this turn</li>
</ul>
