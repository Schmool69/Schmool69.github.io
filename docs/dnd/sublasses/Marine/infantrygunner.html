<h2>Level 3  Sustained Fire</h2>
<p>Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you may mark the target until the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>The marked creature takes additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus the first time you hit it each turn and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of that turn.</p>

<h2>Level 7  Suppression Specialist</h2>
<p>Your mastery of ranged fire enhances your core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a creature fails its saving throw against your Suppressive Fire caused by a ranged weapon attack, it also has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of its next turn</li>
<li>Creatures affected by your Suppressive Fire cannot take the Dash action</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 10  Kill Rhythm</h2>
<p>When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack on consecutive turns, the second hit deals additional damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>This bonus resets if you miss or change targets before your last target dies.</p>

<h2>Level 14  Fire Superiority</h2>
<p>You gain the following benefits while wielding a ranged weapon:</p>
<ul>
<li>You ignore half cover</li>
<li>When a creature you can see within your weapon's normal range attacks an ally, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack roll</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 18  Force of Attrition</h2>
<p>Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you may choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the target's speed to 0 until the start of its next turn</li>
<li>Prevent the target from taking actions this turn</li>
</ul>
<p>If the creature is affected by your Suppressive Fire, you may apply both effects instead.</p>
