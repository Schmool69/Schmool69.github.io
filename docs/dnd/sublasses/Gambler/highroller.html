<h2>Level 3  Set the Stakes</h2>
<p>As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet and declare the stakes.</p>

<p>Choose one stake:</p>

<h3>Reputation</h3>
<p>The creature has disadvantage on its next roll against you. If it fails that roll, you gain advantage on all Charisma-based checks against it for 1 minute.</p>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p>The creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. If it fails an attack roll during this time, it loses its reaction.</p>

<h3>Pressure</h3>
<p>The creature takes a 1 penalty to all d20 rolls until the end of its next turn. If it fails a roll, you gain advantage on your next roll against it.</p>

<p><em>Uses per long rest = Charisma modifier</em></p>

<h2>Level 6  Table Presence</h2>
<p>At the start of a social scene or combat:</p>
<p>Choose one creature you can see. It has disadvantage on its first roll involving you.</p>

<h2>Level 10  Read the Crowd</h2>
<p>When dealing with groups, you may treat a group as a single creature for Tell, House Edge, and any social checks (important with odds dice usage).</p>

<h2>Level 14  Too Big to Fail</h2>
<p>Once per long rest, when you would fail a Charisma-based check, you succeed instead.</p>
