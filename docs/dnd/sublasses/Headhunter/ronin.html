<h2>Level 3 — Honourable Duel</h2>
<p>As a bonus action, you can declare a Duel with your Target.</p>
<p>When you do, a 10-foot radius dueling zone is established around you until the start of your next turn (it moves with you).</p>
<p>Anyone not your target must make a Wisdom saving throw before attacking you or entering the circle (Wisdom DC 8 + PB + Cha Mod). On a fail, the attacker must pick a new target or cancel the attack.</p>
<p>This can be done as many times equal to your proficiency bonus - resets on long rest.</p>

<h2>Level 10 — Piercing Shame</h2>
<p>When you hit your Target with your Signature Weapon and deal Killshot damage, you can mark it with Shame until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>A Shamed creature experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Penalty equal to your proficiency bonus on attack rolls against any creature other than you</li>
<li>Its speed is reduced by 10 ft while moving away from you</li>
<li>Opportunity attacks you make against the Target have advantage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 18 — Way of the Omen</h2>
<p>If your Target is the only enemy within 20 feet of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on attack rolls against the Target</li>
<li>The Target has disadvantage on saving throws against your combat maneuvers (shoving, grappling, etc.)</li>
<li>Killshot damage deals an extra PB d6 (e.g. PB +2 = 2d6)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level 18 — Unbroken Resolve</h2>
<p>When your Target reduces you to 0 HP, you instead drop to 1 HP. (Once per long rest.)</p>
