<h2>Level 3 — Flicker Strike</h2>
<p>When you hit your Target with your Signature Weapon, you may immediately attempt to Hide as part of the same action (no bonus action required).</p>
<p>You don't need full cover — half cover, dim light, or a brief obstruction is enough.</p>
<p>This can be used to instantly use Evanesce and will hide you regardless of obstruction.</p>

<h2>Level 3 — Intangible</h2>
<p>Your Target has disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks made to detect you.</p>

<h2>Level 10 — Fear Echo</h2>
<p>When you deal Killshot damage to your Target, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + PB + Dex or Cha mod).</p>
<p>On a failure, until the end of your next turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is Frightened of you</li>
<li>Its speed is halved</li>
<li>And it cannot take reactions</li>
</ul>
<p>On a success, it still cannot take reactions.</p>

<h2>Level 18 — Veilbreaker</h2>
<p>When you are Hidden from your Target and make an attack against it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attack roll has advantage</li>
<li>It must make a Wisdom saving throw or be Dazed until the start of your next turn. (Once per Target per turn.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>When dazed you can only use one of three in your turn: action, bonus action, movement.</em></p>
