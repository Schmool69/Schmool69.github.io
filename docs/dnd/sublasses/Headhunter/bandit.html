<h2>Level 3 — Dirty Fighting</h2>
<p>You fight to win, not impress.</p>

<h3>Cheap Shot</h3>
<p>If you have advantage on an attack roll against your Target and hit, roll an additional weapon damage die.</p>

<h3>Kick Dirt</h3>
<p>As a bonus action, you can impose disadvantage on your Target's next attack against someone other than you (Uses: PB per long rest).</p>

<h2>Level 10 — Opportunist's Edge</h2>
<p>You excel at exploiting the chaos of battle.</p>
<p>Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you is hit by an ally's attack, you gain +2 to the next attack roll you make before the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>If that creature is your Target, you also deal +PB damage on that next hit.</p>
.
<h2>Level 18 — Nothing Is Off the Table</h2>
<p>You unleash your most vicious techniques.</p>

<h3>Exposed Throat</h3>
<p>When you hit your Target with a Signature Weapon attack while you have advantage, you may reroll all damage dice and use the higher total.</p>

<h3>Cut the Escape</h3>
<p>Your Target cannot take the Disengage or Dash actions while within 20 feet of you.</p>

<h3>Cornered Finisher</h3>
<p>If your Target is below 25% HP, your attacks against them automatically have advantage.</p>
